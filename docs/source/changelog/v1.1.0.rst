MDDC Version 1.1.0
========================

In this version, we have updated the output for the the `MDDC.mddc()` method when method is set to `monte_carlo`.

We now include additional output element: 

- `pval_fisher`: p-values for each cell in the step 2 of the algorithm, calculated using the Monte Carlo method
for cells with count greater than five and p-values obtained from the Fisher's exact test for cells with count 
less than or equal to five in the contingency table.

Another output element `pval` is now updated and and now outputs: p-values for each cell in the step 2 of the algorithm,
calculated using the Monte Carlo method.
